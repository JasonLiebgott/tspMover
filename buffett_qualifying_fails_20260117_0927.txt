DETAILED FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSES - QUALIFYING FAILS
================================================================================


================================================================================
🟡 FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS: AME
================================================================================

🎯 OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: Hold
📊 Composite Score: 0.223
✅ Passed Criteria: 2025-Adjusted
💰 Current Price: $215.65
🏢 Market Cap: $49.8B

💡 INVESTMENT THESIS:

   AME is a decent company that marginally meets investment criteria. While it has
   some attractive qualities with a score of 0.223, investors should monitor closely
   and consider whether better opportunities exist in the market.


💰 PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS:
   
📈 Return on Equity (ROE): 14.6% - FAIR
   This shows how efficiently the company uses shareholder money to generate profits.
   14.6% means for every $100 of shareholder equity, the company generates $14.6 in profit.
   ⚠️ This is acceptable but not impressive.

🏭 Operating Margin: 25.8% - EXCELLENT
   This shows what percentage of revenue becomes operating profit after expenses.
   25.8% means the company keeps $25.8 in operating profit for every $100 of sales.
   ✅ Excellent margins indicate strong pricing power and cost control.

💸 Free Cash Flow: $1.7B per year
   This is the actual cash the company generates that could be returned to shareholders.
   ✅ Positive cash flow is good - the company generates actual cash.

🛡️ FINANCIAL STABILITY:

💳 Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.26 - EXCELLENT
   This shows how much debt the company has relative to shareholder equity.
   A ratio of 0.26 means the company has $0.26 of debt for every $1 of equity.
   ✅ Excellent - very conservative debt levels provide financial flexibility.

🔢 Interest Coverage: 15.7x
   This shows how easily the company can pay its interest expenses.
   The company earns 15.7 times more than needed to cover interest payments.
   ✅ Excellent coverage - no concerns about meeting debt obligations.

💵 VALUATION ANALYSIS:

📊 Price-to-Earnings (P/E): 34.0 - POOR
   This shows how much investors pay for each dollar of annual earnings.
   A P/E of 34.0 means you pay $34.0 for every $1 of annual profit.
   ❌ Expensive - you're paying a premium for earnings.

💰 Price-to-Free Cash Flow: 29.2 - POOR
   This shows how much you pay for each dollar of actual cash the company generates.
   A ratio of 29.2 means you pay $29.2 for every $1 of annual cash flow.
   ❌ Expensive - paying a high price for cash flow.

🚀 PEG Ratio: 1.50
   This adjusts the P/E ratio for growth rate. A PEG under 1.0 suggests good value.
   ⚠️ Fair - paying for growth but not excessive.

📈 GROWTH CONSISTENCY:

📊 Average Annual Earnings Growth: 11.7%
   Over the last 3 years, earnings grew an average of 11.7% per year.
   ✅ Good growth rate indicating a healthy business.

📉 Growth Volatility: 0.054
   This measures how consistent the growth has been (lower is better).
   ✅ Very consistent growth - predictable business model.

📅 Negative Growth Years: 0 out of 3
   ✅ No down years - remarkably consistent performance.

🏰 COMPETITIVE MOAT:

🎯 Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): 11.7%
   This shows how efficiently the company uses its invested capital to generate returns.
   ⚠️ Fair ROIC - company has some competitive advantages.

💪 Gross Margin Advantage: +10.9% vs industry average
   The company's gross margin is 10.9% higher than competitors.
   ✅ Significant margin advantage indicates strong pricing power.

🏆 Brand Value Score: 64.902608896/100
   ⚠️ Moderate brand strength - some competitive protection.

🌐 Network Effects: No
   ⚠️ No network effects - growth depends on traditional competitive advantages.

⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW RISK

🚨 Key Risks to Monitor:
   1. High valuation leaves little margin of safety

🎯 ACTION PLAN:
   
   📊 STRATEGY: Hold current position but don't add new money
   🔍 MONITORING: Watch closely for improvement or deterioration
   ⚖️ REVIEW: Consider selling if better opportunities arise
   📉 EXIT TRIGGERS: Sell if fundamentals worsen or valuation becomes excessive
   
   🔄 DECISION POINT: Reassess in 6 months
