REBALANCING STRATEGY
================================================================================
Schedule: Quarterly (every 3 months)

Rebalancing Triggers:
• Any category deviates >5% from target allocation
• Major economic events (Fed policy changes, inflation data)
• Significant market volatility (VIX >30 for sustained period)
• Individual fund performance diverges significantly from peers

Timeline Plan:
• 0-3 months: Initial deployment, monitor for major deviations
• 3-6 months: First rebalancing, assess performance vs inflation
• 6-12 months: Quarterly reviews, tactical adjustments
• 12+ months: Annual strategy review, consider category weight changes

Monitoring Metrics:
• Portfolio correlation to inflation (CPI, PCE)
• Real returns vs inflation rate
• Category performance vs targets
• Overall portfolio volatility vs market

================================================================================
RISK MANAGEMENT & AVOIDANCE RULES
================================================================================
Position Sizing Rules:
• Max Single Fund: 15% (prevents over-concentration)
• Max Single Category: As defined by strategy (25% max for commodities)
• Min Diversification: At least 6 different holdings
• Liquidity Buffer: 10% in cash/cash equivalents

OVERBOUGHT DETECTION SYSTEM:

Rsi Thresholds:
  • RSI >85: Avoid new positions (extremely overbought)
  • RSI >75: Reduce allocation by 50% (very overbought)
  • RSI >70: Monitor closely for exit signals (overbought)
  • RSI <30: Consider increased allocation (oversold opportunity)

Moving Average Signals:
  • Price >25% above 50-day MA: Heavy penalty for new positions
  • Price >35% above 200-day MA: Avoid until reversion
  • Price >20% above both MAs: Reduce to minimum allocation

Momentum Indicators:
  • Rate of Change >40% in 30 days: Avoid (unsustainable)
  • Rate of Change >25% in 30 days: Monitor for reversal
  • 12+ consecutive gain days: Likely exhaustion pattern

Bollinger Band Signals:
  • Price >95% of Bollinger Band range: Extreme overbought
  • Price >80% of Bollinger Band range: Monitor for reversal
  • Volume divergence with price gains: Bearish signal

AVOIDANCE STRATEGY:

Overvalued Metrics:
  • P/E ratios >30 for broad market funds
  • Funds with >50% concentration in single sector
  • REITs with >20 P/FFO ratios in high interest rate environment
  • ETFs with RSI >80 for >1 week
  • Funds >30% above 200-day moving average

Speculative Assets:
  • Single stock concentration >5% in any fund
  • Cryptocurrency ETFs
  • Leveraged or inverse ETFs
  • Penny stock or micro-cap focused funds
  • Funds with >15 consecutive gain days

Overleveraged Positions:
  • Margin or borrowed money for investments
  • Total portfolio >100% invested (maintain cash buffer)
  • Options strategies beyond covered calls

Tax Inefficient:
  • High turnover funds in taxable accounts
  • Bond funds in high tax brackets (prefer TIPS)
  • REIT funds outside of retirement accounts

Herd Following:
  • Avoid recent hot sectors with >50% YTD gains
  • Avoid funds with >50% inflows in past quarter
  • Avoid copying popular investor picks without analysis
  • Avoid funds trending on social media without fundamental analysis
  • Avoid ETFs with >40% rate of change in 30 days

Monitoring Stop Rules:
• Fund Level: Remove fund if underperforms category by >15% for 6 months
• Category Level: Reduce allocation if category fails strategy for 2 quarters
• Portfolio Level: Major review if portfolio underperforms inflation +3% for 1 year
• Overbought Stop Rules:
  - Reduce position by 50% if RSI >85 for 3+ days
  - Exit position if >40% above 200-day MA with volume divergence
  - Rebalance if any fund >20% above target allocation due to gains

Rebalancing Triggers:
• Technical Signals:
  - Any fund with RSI >80 for sustained period
  - Multiple funds showing overbought conditions simultaneously
  - Portfolio correlation >0.9 (reduced diversification)
  - VIX <15 with multiple overbought signals (complacency warning)
• Fundamental Signals:
  - Inflation expectations shifting significantly
  - Federal Reserve policy changes
  - Commodity prices disconnecting from fundamentals
  - Currency volatility affecting international allocations

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
================================================================================
Step 1: Account Setup

• Ensure accounts can trade all recommended ETFs
• Set up automatic investing if available

Step 2: Initial Deployment
• Deploy funds gradually over 2-4 weeks to average into positions
• Start with largest allocations first
• Keep 10% in cash initially for opportunities

Step 3: Ongoing Management
• Review portfolio monthly
• Rebalance quarterly or when triggers hit
• Monitor inflation data and Fed policy closely
• Adjust allocations based on economic conditions

Step 4: Tax Optimization
• Hold bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts
• Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts
• Consider municipal bonds for high tax brackets
