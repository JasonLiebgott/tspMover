Strategy: 6-month momentum + 200-day MA filter + Top 2-3 equal weight

STRATEGY OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------
This simplified momentum strategy focuses on maximum diversification across
uncorrelated asset classes rather than the number of positions. Based on
academic research showing momentum persistence, but simplified for robustness.

Core Principles:
• 7 uncorrelated asset classes for maximum diversification
• 6-month momentum lookback (optimal period from research)
• 200-day moving average trend filter
• Top 2-3 qualifying positions, equally weighted
• Monthly or quarterly rebalancing
• Simple rules for consistency and discipline

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION RULES
================================================================================
Selection Criteria:
1. Calculate 6-month rate of change for each of 7 core ETFs
2. Filter: Keep only ETFs with price above 200-day moving average
3. Filter: Keep only ETFs with positive 6-month momentum
4. Rank: Sort qualifying ETFs by 6-month momentum (highest first)
5. Select: Choose top 2-3 qualifying ETFs
6. Weight: Equal weight allocation across selected ETFs

Rebalancing Schedule:
• Monthly evaluation: First trading day of each month
• Recalculate 6-month momentum for all 7 ETFs
• Apply filters (200-day MA + positive momentum)
• Compare new top 2-3 vs. current holdings
• Execute trades only if holdings change
• Rebalance to equal weights quarterly

Position Management:
• Maximum positions: 3
• Minimum positions: 2 (if 2+ qualify)
• Equal weighting: Each position gets 1/N allocation
• No position sizing based on momentum strength
• No stop losses (momentum filter handles exits)

ACADEMIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION
----------------------------------------
This simplified approach is based on key findings from momentum research:

Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) - 'Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers':
• 3-12 month momentum persistence in equity markets
• 6-month lookback near optimal for momentum strategies
• Trend-following filters improve risk-adjusted returns

Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen (2012) - 'Time Series Momentum':
• Momentum works across ALL asset classes
• Cross-asset diversification more important than within-asset
• Simple rules often outperform complex optimizations

Key Academic Insights for This Strategy:
• Diversification across uncorrelated assets > number of positions
• 6-month lookback balances signal strength with noise
• 200-day MA filter reduces whipsaws and drawdowns
• Equal weighting avoids over-concentration risk
• Monthly rebalancing captures momentum shifts without over-trading

RISK MANAGEMENT
----------------------------------------
Built-in Risk Controls:
• Diversification: Maximum 7 uncorrelated asset classes
• Trend Filter: 200-day MA prevents buying into downtrends
• Momentum Filter: Positive 6-month return requirement
• Equal Weighting: Prevents over-concentration in single asset
• Regular Rebalancing: Captures momentum regime changes

Scenario Planning:
• Bull Market: Strategy captures uptrending assets
• Bear Market: Filters force cash/defensive positioning
• Sideways Market: Frequent rotations, lower returns
• Crisis: Momentum reversal risk, but diversification helps

Risk Warnings:
• Momentum can reverse suddenly during market stress
• Strategy may go to cash if no assets qualify
• Performance poor in choppy, trendless markets
• Monthly trading generates tax implications
• Past performance does not guarantee future results

MONTHLY IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
----------------------------------------
First Trading Day of Month:
1. Download 6+ months of price data for all 7 ETFs
2. Calculate 6-month rate of change: (Current - 6M Ago) / 6M Ago
3. Calculate 200-day moving average for each ETF
4. Filter 1: Keep only ETFs above 200-day MA
5. Filter 2: Keep only ETFs with positive 6-month momentum
6. Rank qualifying ETFs by 6-month momentum (high to low)
7. Select top 2-3 qualifying ETFs
8. Compare to current holdings
9. Execute trades if holdings change
10. Equal weight remaining allocation

If No ETFs Qualify:
• Move to 100% cash/money market
• Continue monthly evaluation
• Wait for momentum and trend signals to align
• Do not force trades or lower standards
